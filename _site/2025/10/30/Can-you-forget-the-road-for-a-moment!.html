                    <p class="post-description">A reflection written after watching The Long Walk (2025 movie) — less about the film itself and more about the silence that follows it.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p class="post-date">October 30, 2025</p>
                     
                    <div class="post-content"><p>We were there, in the desert of faithfulness. All of us were there — or perhaps we must be there. When the wind of doubt begins to blow, we retreat to our silent hills, trying not to lose consciousness. That’s what I took away from my epistemology class.</p>

<p>This movie made me wonder what has happened to Stephen King’s mindset from <strong>The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</strong> until now. How could such a massive thinker forget the truth in order to stay away from reality? Or perhaps he hasn’t forgotten — maybe he hides his homesickness for <strong>Stanley Kubrick</strong> behind his newer works.</p>

<p>There are no women here — only masculine bodies striving to overcome the race against nothingness on the empty side of history. The story isn’t about America, or any other country; it’s about a feeling — the feeling of being absolutely fucked. These men are not in an apocalypse but in a cruel, undefined dystopia. The road is not a cure for depression; it is merely the only way forward, a strip of asphalt stretching through a southern U.S. state haunted by a classic, silent religiosity.</p>

<p>When I saw the church, I thought of our neighbor’s mosque in the afternoon light. The fields — which can be seen as the masses of people (توده) — serve as both the opposite and the reflection of military tanks.</p>

<p>I don’t want to mention any characters, for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I don’t want to spoil the story.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m not good at writing names in English.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The friendships formed along the way exist only for the moment. The man who tries to live in the moment preserves the illusion of goodness — but that goodness might just be a mask to defeat his imagined enemies. He cannot sleep or dream, so he cannot be defeated within the box of his mind.</p>

<p>There is no devil here — only poor souls who cannot father or be fathered by one another. They do not act from consciousness; they merely accept what happens. This “long walk” is not mandatory, yet everyone participates. Everyone is guilty, and no one remembers the tenderness of the old, cruel world — a world where philosophical books and classical music are now forbidden.</p>

<p>We can imagine and analyze every kind of crime around us — but what about the crimes committed by the state? And what about the thing we see when we look beneath our own shirts: the brutal monster that wants to rule and destroy?</p>

<p>Don’t call me an anarchist!</p>
