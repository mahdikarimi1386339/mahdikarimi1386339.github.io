                    <div class="post-content"><p>I’ve spent most of my short life exploring and making decisions about religion—and how it works not in theory, but through real, human relationships. In this long process, I’ve discovered something troubling inside myself: sometimes, involuntarily, I want to convince others to protect the cultural figures of my country.
For instance, when I recently found out that many people in Türkiye admire Hafez and Rumi—two of the greatest Persian poets—I felt a surge of anger and irrational possessiveness. A loud voice inside me shouted, “Wait, they’re Turks! They’re trying to steal your country’s cultural legacy!” That reaction was raw, impulsive, and disturbing. But I wanted to talk to ChatGPT about it—because it taught me something deeper.
I realized I had stepped into the trap of tribalism. I forgot that we live in the 21st century, and that the true history of literature has already been written long ago. In fact, if your culture contains the most brilliant works of art and poetry, it doesn’t automatically make you a brilliant or civilized person. That’s a hard truth. What matters is not where greatness comes from—but what you do with it, how you honor it, and how you share it.
Tribalism makes us act like Neanderthals, not because we’re evil, but because we’re afraid to be alone in the world.</p>

<h2>Ideologies Sell You a Form of Belonging</h2>
<p>It’s true that when you are truly human—emotionally open, sensitive, honest—you care about what belongs to you. You defend it. Sometimes you even extend that sense of ownership to things that don’t strictly belong to you—like cultural icons, ancient language, or national myths. Why? Because you want to feel belonged, accepted, and loved by the tribe that shares those things with you.
Ideologies exploit this need. They dress tribal feelings in the costume of morality, patriotism, or faith. They tell you, “You are righteous to defend your people,” and often, that’s partially true. But it’s also incomplete. They don’t ask you to question why you feel so angry when your culture is “borrowed” or celebrated by others. They rarely remind you that art, poetry, philosophy—these things don’t belong to tribes. They belong to humanity.
Belonging is beautiful. But when it turns into ownership, it poisons the very thing you love.</p>

<h2>What They Never Tell You About This Instinct</h2>
<p>The need to protect what feels “ours” doesn’t come from a sacred place—it comes from ancient instinct. It’s deeply wired into human survival: defend the tribe, stay with your group, don’t let outsiders take what’s yours. This isn’t evil—this is evolution. But here’s the problem: we’re not living in caves anymore.
We are (supposedly) civilized. We have morality, philosophy, and history at our disposal. We can ask questions that our ancestors couldn’t even imagine. So yes, maybe honor and morality are not “natural” in the same way instinct is. But that doesn’t mean they’re meaningless. In fact, the fact that we choose them—that we build them—makes them even more powerful.
A real human being doesn’t just obey instincts. A real human being creates values.
We must rethink our traditions, especially the ones that make us fear or hate others for sharing “our” culture. Loving your heritage doesn’t require hating someone else’s admiration for it. The more we can let go of ownership and embrace connection, the more we become worthy of the culture we claim to protect.</p>
