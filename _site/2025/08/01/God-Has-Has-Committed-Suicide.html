                     <p>We fucked him. We slaughtered him. Some of us tried to destroy him; others just watched him suffer.
 He didn’t hesitate. He knew what he was part of—a legend. Not a legend of victory, but of annihilation.
They didn’t understand what it meant to stand outside the herd—or to become its maker. They lived as the opposite of good.
This wasn’t the Colosseum. It wasn’t the Shoah. It was something else: how we outlived them, and how they still changed us—both the decaying elders and the devout.
And who will stop this madness?
We must.
 Not just for those who come after, but for ourselves.
When I say “we,” I mean those who have lost faith in society—but still believe in goodness, and something deeper than beauty.
