I don’t know where this is going, but I will continue writing my honorable story. In the heavens – I forgot to say “Once upon a time…”. Adam and Eve started to have babies, yet God was not satisfied. He made an excuse about a tree or something like that, for deporting them from the heavens to the Earth. They traveled around the globe and spread their genes everywhere they could.

Meanwhile in the divine realm, God was hanging around the heavens and talking to his folks. Suddenly, Gabriel showed up and said, “Do you know what is happening, my Lord?” God replied, “Not exactly!” He said, “Sire! Humans are launching a rocket towards us!” God was shocked and called his gorgeous angels, who precisely wore nothing, and grabbed one of them while thinking, “I thought they would not survive, but they did. What shall I do now?”

He was walking around his throne with his metaphorical legs, which are unknown for every religion, I can say. He decided to write a letter for all humans on the planet. He started to write with this sentence: “In my name, which is sacred.” He continued, “And I am your Lord, because I should be self-existent, for I am the cause of causes – but I can’t take the responsibility for evil and the existence of genocide in Gaza. Everybody knows that I am not a jerk. One time Gabriel just said that there is a guy who is called Abraham, and he wanted to annoy him and his children, so I gave him the permission, for I assumed that he was a jinn or something. I did not even know about your existence. Please, just leave us alone and do not launch the freaking rocket.” He added, “Your lovely lover, God.”

He signed the letter and gave it to Gabriel to deliver it. Unfortunately, he or she or they or whatever (I am afraid of misgendering again) got shot by Soviet Union soldiers in 1944, around Moscow.
