title: Can you forget the road for a moment?
description:  A reflection written after watching The Long Walk (2025 movie) — less about the film itself and more about the silence that follows it.

We were there, in the desert of faithfulness. All of us were there — or perhaps we must be there. When the wind of doubt begins to blow, we retreat to our silent hills, trying not to lose consciousness. That’s what I took away from my epistemology class.

This movie made me wonder what has happened to Stephen King’s mindset from **The Shawshank Redemption (1994)** until now. How could such a massive thinker forget the truth in order to stay away from reality? Or perhaps he hasn’t forgotten — maybe he hides his homesickness for **Stanley Kubrick** behind his newer works.

There are no women here — only masculine bodies striving to overcome the race against nothingness on the empty side of history. The story isn’t about America, or any other country; it’s about a feeling — the feeling of being absolutely fucked. These men are not in an apocalypse but in a cruel, undefined dystopia. The road is not a cure for depression; it is merely the only way forward, a strip of asphalt stretching through a southern U.S. state haunted by a classic, silent religiosity.

When I saw the church, I thought of our neighbor’s mosque in the afternoon light. The fields — which can be seen as the masses of people (توده) — serve as both the opposite and the reflection of military tanks.

I don’t want to mention any characters, for two reasons:

1. I don’t want to spoil the story.
    
2. I’m not good at writing names in English.
    

The friendships formed along the way exist only for the moment. The man who tries to live in the moment preserves the illusion of goodness — but that goodness might just be a mask to defeat his imagined enemies. He cannot sleep or dream, so he cannot be defeated within the box of his mind.

There is no devil here — only poor souls who cannot father or be fathered by one another. They do not act from consciousness; they merely accept what happens. This “long walk” is not mandatory, yet everyone participates. Everyone is guilty, and no one remembers the tenderness of the old, cruel world — a world where philosophical books and classical music are now forbidden.

We can imagine and analyze every kind of crime around us — but what about the crimes committed by the state? And what about the thing we see when we look beneath our own shirts: the brutal monster that wants to rule and destroy?

Don’t call me an anarchist!
